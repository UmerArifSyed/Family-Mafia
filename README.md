### üåü Project Overview

This project is a web-based, real-time implementation of the classic party game, Mafia (also known as Werewolf). It is designed to be a streamlined, easy-to-use platform for friends to play together, with a focus on a single-page application experience. The game is moderated by one of the players, who guides the flow of the game, while all other players secretly receive a role and try to outwit their opponents.
